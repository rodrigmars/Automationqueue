# Automation Queue

Project still under development to simulate situations involving communication between threads using the python language. This algorithm handles **FIFO(First-In-First-Out)** operations for message handling using mult-threadign. The consumer is responsible for receiving the messages sent and carrying out a transaction either for bank operations or triggering pre-scheduled processes.
